Markowitz model and montercarlo simulations to build robust risk averse investment portfolios

📈 The system uses Modern Portfolio Theory to allocate assets

➡️We use Pypfopt to allocate assets based on the Efficient Frontier

➡️The allocation of asset aims to get the maximum returns with least risk

➡️For risk management, there is a montercarlo simulation that 10000 to 1000000 simulations of random price changes at 20% price changes

💡APP system

The app is built on django framework, However the data presentation is slowly done with plotly's DASH APPLICATIONS

📝Lessons Learnt

⚡️Use of finance and big data API's to create models for investing.

⚡️Data presentation using web friendly framework ie Dash

⚡️General risk assesment using montercarlo simulations, to correctly evaluate risk

⚡Improved use of Object Oriented Programming to access various values
